                            <h4>June 2, 2019</h4>
                            <p>I'm trying this delicious parfait styled sour at a 7% ABV here at Kinsmen Brewing that has a mixture of strawberry kiwi, rooibos tea, and vanilla flavors.</p>

                            <p>Initial aromas are primarity passion fruit and secondary strawberry kiwi.</p>
                            <p>Initial sips come with a tart, puckery flavor.  Definitely can feel the sourness on the tongue.  
                            </p>
                            <p>A cool and refreshing drink a perfect choice to present to someone whose initial thoughts are that they don't like beer
                            and those who prefer drinks like wine, wine coolers, hard lemonades and twisted teas.
                            </p>
                            <p>Recommended for those who like fruity, clean, crisp, sweet, and a drink that although is a beer, does not taste like one.
                            </p>

                            </h5>
                            <h4>June 2, 2019</h4>
                            <p>We are trying this Salted Peanut Butter Porter called the "Clusternutter Porter" from Alvarium in New Britian, CT.</p>
                            <p>Initial aromas consist notes similar to a chocolate peanut butter cup.
                            <br>It has a dark hue, which is great since I prefer darker beers like stouts, porters, and brown ales.  I'm met with a nice foam layer on top prior to my enjoyment of this dark ale.    
                            </p>
                            <p>As I'm tasting it I am impressed.  Out of many peanut and peanut butter style beers, this one definitely meets the expectations for what you are looking for in this style of beer. The peanut butter characteristics are very true to taste,making it one of the best Peanut Butter beers I've had so far.
                            <br>I find that at times the taste chocolatey taste of the toasted malts overpowers and masks the peanut butter which results in hints or no flavor at all. Also lot of times the aromas of the beers add to the flavor profile, but with this it definitely is not needed and does not have to support it because the flavor taste stands out.

                            </h5>

                            <p>So here I am with a Natural Light Strawberry Lemonade Light beer.</p>

                            <p>At 4.2% it's light, fruity, pale in color and smooth going in and down.  No aftertaste, but it's a light beer.</p>

                            <p>There is a noticable strawberry lemonade scent when you pop the top that already tells you it's going to be sweet going down.  It's not sugary sweet, more like a white wine kinda sweet.Pleasant to the tongue and you can't even taste the alcohol.</p> 
                                
                            <p>This is great for days where you are lounging and looking to relax, definitely not for those looking to get hammered.  It's great for people with low alcohol tolerance or who don't like beer. 
                            I think this would go nice with a light chicken or seafood meal....maybe even fajitas!</p>

                            <p>I'd have to say after having various samples and the Stout I am very impressed with the quality and smoothness of both of these ales.</p>

                            <p>I usually am a bit nervous with a dark brew because I usually expect a strong bite or bitterness to accompany it, the cleanest of the stout is a very pleasant surprise.  The light scent of the chocolate helps to boost the taste of it in a very classy way. I believe that the scent of a good brew is important in affecting the taste of a good beer.  It packs a nice percentage of ABV at 9% in which I felt a bit of warmth after sip No. 3, lol.  I really enjoyed this stout which I got to make up for there limited release of the similarly appreciated Coffee Spectral Beast (such a rare sought after beast that one is).</p> 
                                
                            <p>Second brew enjoyed was the Connbination which is a Relic Brewing collaboration with Thomas Hooker including a juicy mix of mosaic, citra and El Dorado.  Coming at a ABV of 7% this is a very nice light beer.  Nice scent with taste of the Citra being so mellow and goes down so smooth.  I'd have to say as far as Citrusy drinks it is easier to drink than others I have sampled at other breweries.</p>
